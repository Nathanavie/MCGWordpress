# MCGWordpress

## Decisions Made
 * Use SVGs and SVG animations 
     * This was done to allow faster loading of small images and allow the animations to be easy on the eyes
 * Create a small 'glitch' animation using the image in the background
     * This was done to create a CTA that would keep user's attention on the page, but not distract them from the content as the duration of the animation is so short
 * Mobile View
     * This was done to give a feel of a small device (developed against pixel 2) and show how the background could work when behind dark text.
